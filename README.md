# 🧠 Meta-Learning MVP with Latent Space Representations

Exploring **meta-learning for classifier ensembles** using **latent space representations**. Built for reproducibility, ease of setup, and rapid experimentation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Meta-learning framework for evaluating and optimizing ensembles
- Leverages latent space transformations to enhance classification
- Fully containerized with **Docker** and **VS Code Dev Containers**
- Ideal for research, experimentation, and educational use

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/le0nce/meta_learing_mvp.git
   cd meta_learing_mvp
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code**
    Launch VS Code and open the cloned folder.

3. **Rebuild in Dev Container**
    Press ``Ctrl + Shift + P`` (or ``Cmd + Shift + P`` on macOS) and select:
    ```yaml
